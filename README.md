# EasyOtp

![Alt text](/readme/observer_example.png?raw=true "Observer Example running a GenServer and Agent")

This library is just to be a real quick and easy example of how to dynamically supervisor genservers and agents.

Copied the Agent and GenServer from the Elixir documentation circa 2022/05/24
